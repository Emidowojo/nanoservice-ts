# Example: Feedback UI

**This page is a placeholder.**

The content for the "Feedback UI" example is currently unavailable. This example is intended to demonstrate building a simple feedback collection mechanism using Nanoservice-ts, which might involve a UI Node for capturing user input and other nodes for storing or processing the feedback.

## Intended Purpose

*   Showcase creating simple interactive UIs with Nanoservice-ts.
*   Illustrate how to handle user input submitted via a UI.
*   Provide an example of a complete loop from UI interaction to backend processing.

We will update this page once the content is available.
