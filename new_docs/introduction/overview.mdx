# Overview of Nanoservice-ts

Welcome to Nanoservice-ts, an open-source framework designed to simplify backend development by enabling developers to implement the **nanoservices architecture** effortlessly. Built with **TypeScript**, this framework helps you create lightweight, modular, and scalable backend systems that adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.

## What is Nanoservice-ts?

Nanoservice-ts empowers you to break down complex backend applications into small, independent, and reusable units called nanoservices. Each nanoservice focuses on a single, well-defined task. These nanoservices can then be orchestrated into powerful workflows to implement your business logic.

By combining an intuitive API, programmatic workflow orchestration, and powerful tooling (including a dedicated CLI), Nanoservice-ts allows you to focus on writing business logic while abstracting the complexities of infrastructure, scaling, and resource management.

## Core Philosophy

Modern backend development often suffers from over-engineered solutions, resource inefficiencies, and complex architectures. Nanoservice-ts addresses these pain points by offering:

*   **Extreme Modularity**: Divide backend logic into highly granular, reusable, single-responsibility units (Nodes) that are easy to manage, test, scale, and debug.
*   **Developer-Friendly Experience**: Utilize TypeScript-powered APIs, project templates, and a comprehensive Command Line Interface (`nanoctl`) for rapid project setup, Node creation, and Workflow generation.
*   **Efficiency and Scalability**: Built to support dynamic workflows with containerized execution (optional) and independent scalability for each nanoservice, optimizing resource usage.
*   **Workflow-Centric Orchestration**: Define and manage the sequence and interaction of nanoservices through declarative Workflow definitions (JSON or programmatic).
*   **Extensibility**: Easily create custom Nodes to encapsulate any specific functionality or integrate with third-party services.
*   **Community-Driven**: Collaborate, share, and benefit from a growing library of community-created Nodes and Workflows.

With Nanoservice-ts, backend development becomes more modular, predictable, and future-proof, making it ideal for a wide range of applications, from simple APIs to complex, event-driven systems and large-scale enterprise backends.

## Key Concepts

Before diving deeper, let's familiarize ourselves with some core concepts in Nanoservice-ts:

*   **Nodes**: The smallest functional units, each designed to perform a specific, atomic task within a workflow (e.g., make an API call, query a database, transform data).
*   **Workflows**: A sequence or graph of interconnected Nodes that collectively achieve a larger piece of business logic. Workflows define how data flows between Nodes and the order of execution.
*   **Triggers**: Events or conditions that initiate the execution of a Workflow. Triggers can be HTTP requests, scheduled events (cron jobs), messages from a queue, gRPC calls, or custom events.
*   **Context Object**: A shared object available to all Nodes within a Workflow instance, allowing them to pass data, share state, and access configuration or services.
*   **`nanoctl` (CLI)**: The command-line tool for creating, managing, and running Nanoservice-ts projects, Nodes, and Workflows.

This documentation will guide you through installing Nanoservice-ts, understanding its fundamental components, learning various techniques, and exploring practical examples to help you build powerful applications.
