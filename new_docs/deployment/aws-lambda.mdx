# Deploying Nanoservice-ts to AWS Lambda

**This page is a placeholder.**

This section will provide a comprehensive guide on packaging and deploying Nanoservice-ts applications as AWS Lambda functions.

## Intended Content

*   **Overview of AWS Lambda for Nanoservice-ts**: Benefits and considerations for running Nanoservice-ts on AWS Lambda.
*   **Prerequisites**: AWS account, AWS CLI configured, Node.js, Nanoservice-ts project ready for deployment.
*   **Packaging for Lambda**: How to bundle your Nanoservice-ts application (including the runtime, nodes, and workflows) into a Lambda-compatible deployment package (e.g., ZIP file).
    *   Handling dependencies.
    *   Tree-shaking and minimizing package size.
*   **Lambda Handler Function**: Creating a Lambda handler function (e.g., `index.handler`) that initializes and runs your Nanoservice-ts workflow based on Lambda event triggers.
*   **Serverless Framework / AWS SAM**: Using tools like the Serverless Framework or AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to define and deploy your Nanoservice-ts application as Lambda functions and related resources (e.g., API Gateway, IAM roles).
*   **Trigger Configuration**:
    *   **API Gateway**: Setting up API Gateway to trigger your Nanoservice-ts Lambda for HTTP-based workflows.
    *   **Other AWS Triggers**: Integrating with other AWS services as triggers (e.g., SQS, S3 Events, EventBridge).
*   **Environment Variables & Configuration**: Managing configuration and secrets for your Lambda functions.
*   **IAM Permissions**: Defining necessary IAM roles and policies for your Lambda function to access other AWS resources or external services.
*   **Logging and Monitoring**: Accessing logs via CloudWatch Logs and monitoring Lambda execution with CloudWatch Metrics and X-Ray.
*   **Cold Starts & Performance**: Strategies for managing cold starts and optimizing performance.
*   **Example**: A step-by-step tutorial of deploying a sample Nanoservice-ts application to AWS Lambda.

Content will be added here once detailed information and best practices for deploying Nanoservice-ts applications to AWS Lambda are available.
