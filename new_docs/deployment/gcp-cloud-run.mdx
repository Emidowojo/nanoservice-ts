# Deploying Nanoservice-ts to Google Cloud Run

**This page is a placeholder.**

This section will provide a detailed guide on containerizing and deploying Nanoservice-ts applications to Google Cloud Run.

## Intended Content

*   **Overview of Google Cloud Run for Nanoservice-ts**: Benefits of using Cloud Run (serverless, containers, auto-scaling) for Nanoservice-ts applications.
*   **Prerequisites**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, `gcloud` CLI configured, Docker installed, Nanoservice-ts project ready.
*   **Containerizing Nanoservice-ts**: Creating a `Dockerfile` to package your Nanoservice-ts application (including the runtime, nodes, workflows, and dependencies) into a Docker container image.
    *   Optimizing the Docker image for size and security.
    *   Handling Node.js versions and dependencies within the container.
*   **Building and Pushing the Container Image**: Using Docker to build the image and pushing it to Google Container Registry (GCR) or Artifact Registry.
*   **Deploying to Cloud Run**: Using the `gcloud` CLI or Google Cloud Console to deploy the container image to Cloud Run.
    *   Configuring Cloud Run service settings (e.g., region, memory, CPU, concurrency, min/max instances).
    *   Setting up triggers (e.g., HTTP endpoint for public access, Pub/Sub for event-driven workflows).
*   **Environment Variables & Secrets**: Managing configuration and secrets in Cloud Run, potentially using Secret Manager.
*   **IAM Permissions**: Configuring service account permissions for your Cloud Run service if it needs to access other GCP services.
*   **Logging and Monitoring**: Accessing logs via Cloud Logging and monitoring service performance with Cloud Monitoring.
*   **Custom Domains and Load Balancing**: Setting up custom domains and integrating with Google Cloud Load Balancing if needed.
*   **Example**: A step-by-step tutorial of containerizing and deploying a sample Nanoservice-ts application to Google Cloud Run.

Content will be added here once detailed information and best practices for deploying Nanoservice-ts applications to Google Cloud Run are available.
