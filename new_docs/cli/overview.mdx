# Nanoservice-ts CLI (`nanoctl`)

The Nanoservice-ts Command Line Interface (CLI), `nanoctl`, is an essential tool for developing, managing, and deploying your Nanoservice-ts applications. It provides a set of commands to streamline common tasks, from project scaffolding to Node and Workflow creation.

## What is `nanoctl`?

`nanoctl` is designed to enhance developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks and providing a consistent interface for interacting with the Nanoservice-ts framework.

Key functionalities typically include:

*   **Project Initialization**: Creating new Nanoservice-ts projects with a standard directory structure and boilerplate code.
*   **Code Generation (Scaffolding)**: Generating new Nodes, Workflows, and potentially other components with basic templates.
*   **Development Server**: Running a local development server to test your workflows.
*   **Building & Packaging**: Preparing your application for deployment.
*   **Deployment Commands**: Assisting with deploying your Nanoservice-ts applications to various environments (though this might also involve other platform-specific tools).
*   **Authentication/Login**: Commands to authenticate with Nanoservice-ts services or platforms (e.g., Deskree).

## Installation / Usage

As mentioned in the [First Steps](../introduction/first-steps.mdx) guide, you can often use `nanoctl` directly via `npx` without a global installation, ensuring you always use the latest version:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest <command>
```

Alternatively, you might install it globally if you prefer, or it might be included as a development dependency in your project.

```bash
npm install -g nanoctl
# or add to project devDependencies
# npm install --save-dev nanoctl
```
Refer to the official Nanoservice-ts installation instructions for the recommended approach.

## Common Command Categories

This section of the documentation will cover the main commands provided by `nanoctl`, grouped by their purpose:

*   **[Project Management](./project.mdx)**: Commands related to creating and managing Nanoservice-ts projects.
    *   `nanoctl create project <project-name>`
*   **[Node Management](./nodes.mdx)**: Commands for scaffolding and managing Nodes.
    *   `nanoctl create node <node-name>`
*   **[Workflow Management](./workflows.mdx)**: Commands for scaffolding and managing Workflows.
    *   `nanoctl create workflow <workflow-name>`
*   **[Authentication](./login.mdx)**: Commands for logging into Nanoservice-ts platforms or services.

*   **[Build Process](./build.mdx)**: Commands related to building your application for production.
    *   `nanoctl build` (conceptual)
*   **[Deployment](./deploy.mdx)**: Commands to assist with deploying your application.
    *   `nanoctl deploy` (conceptual)

## Getting Help

Most CLI tools provide a way to get help directly from the command line. You can usually try:

```bash
nanoctl --help
nanoctl <command> --help
```

This will display a list of available commands or specific options for a given command.

Explore the sub-sections for detailed explanations and examples of each `nanoctl` command group.
