# MCP Server in Nanoservice-ts

**This page is a placeholder.**

The content for the "MCP (Multi-Compatible Protocol) Server" is currently under development or requires further research based on its specific implementation and relevance within the Nanoservice-ts ecosystem.

## Intended Scope (Future Content)

If MCP Server is a feature or component of Nanoservice-ts, this section would aim to cover:

*   **What is MCP Server?**: An explanation of its purpose, the problems it solves, and its core concepts.
*   **Supported Protocols**: Details on which protocols are supported by the MCP Server (e.g., HTTP, gRPC, WebSockets, MQTT, etc., simultaneously or interchangeably).
*   **Use Cases**: Scenarios where an MCP Server would be beneficial (e.g., unifying different communication types, providing flexible endpoints for diverse clients).
*   **Configuration**: How to set up and configure the MCP Server within a Nanoservice-ts project.
*   **Triggering Workflows via MCP**: How workflows can be initiated through the various protocols handled by the MCP Server.
*   **Node Interactions**: If specific nodes are designed to interact with or leverage the MCP Server.
*   **Examples**: Practical examples of using the MCP Server.

We will update this page with accurate information as it becomes available or once its role in Nanoservice-ts is clarified.
