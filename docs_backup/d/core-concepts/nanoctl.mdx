`nanoservice-ts` is using [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) for our CLI called `nanoctl`. `nanoctl` is a command-line tool designed to simplify the creation and setup of nanoservice projects. It enables developers to quickly initialize ready-to-use project structures with minimal configuration.

# Commands

Below is the list of all existing `npx nanoctl` commands:

### Create Project

Command responsbile for instantiating a new nanoservice project.

```bash
  npx nanoctl@latest create project
```

<Tip>To create the project in the current directory: `npx nanoctl@latest create project .`</Tip>

Requests the following parameters via the CLI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign a name to the project">
    Create project name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose the trigger to install">
    Select a default workflow trigger to install (ex. HTTP). For the list of available triggers and their configurations, check the [Triggers](/docs/d/core-concepts/trigger) page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the project directory and run it">
    `cd <project-name> && npm run dev`
    Then open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/health-check`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The new nanoservice-ts project will be created in the current directory. To learn more visit [Initialization Guide](/docs/d/getting-started/npx).

You can also specify the project name as an argument:

```bash
  npx nanoctl@latest create project --name <project-name>
```

### Create Node

Command responsbile for instantiating a new nanoservice project.

```bash
  npx nanoctl@latest create node
```

<Tip>To create the node in the current directory: `npx nanoctl@latest create node .`</Tip>

Requests the following parameters via the CLI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign a name to the node">
    Create the node name.
  </Step>
</Steps>

A new node will be created in the `nodes` directory of an active nanoservice project. To learn more about nodes, visit the [Nodes](/docs/d/core-concepts/nodes) page. For a detailed guide on how to create a custom node and use it, check out the [Quickstart](/docs/d/quickstart.mdx) page.

You can also specify the node name as an argument:

```bash
  npx nanoctl@latest create node --name <node-name>
```
