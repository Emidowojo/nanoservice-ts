title: Using Templates
---

## 🔧 Quick Start
Get started in minutes with pre-built templates:

* HTTP APIs: Ready-to-use projects with Node.js and Express.
* Scheduled Jobs: CRON-style workflows for task automation.

Run the CLI:
```bash
npx nanoservice-cli create project
```

Select your template, and start coding!

## 💡 Programmatic Workflow Creation
YOu can also use TypeScript helper classes to build workflows programmatically:

```TypeScript
Workflow("my-workflow")
  .trigger("http", config)
  .addStep(apiFetchNode)
  .addStep(customNode)
  .response("json");
```

## Templates Folder
The Templates Folder in nanoservice-ts simplifies starting new projects by providing pre-configured setups for common use cases.

### 🚀 Available Templates

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HTTP API">
    * A Node.js + Express project ready for HTTP-based workflows.
    * Includes folder structure, dependencies, and basic endpoints.
    * Ideal for creating RESTful APIs with custom Nano Services.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scheduled Jobs">
    * A CRON-style setup for automating scheduled workflows.
    * Example use cases: backups, batch processes, or automated reporting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom Nodes">
    * A project template for building and sharing reusable Nano Service nodes.
    * Fully compatible with npm for publishing and reusing nodes across projects.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 🛠️ How to Use Templates

Run the CLI to initialize a project with the desired template:

``` bash
npx nanoservice-cli create project
```
Follow the prompts to:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a template">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your project">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the project folder">
  </Step>
</Steps>

The selected template will be cloned locally with all required configurations ready to use.

### 📂 Folder Structure Example
For the HTTP API template, the default structure looks like this:

```plaintext
my-http-api/
│
├── nodes/           # Custom Nano Services
├── workflows/       # Workflow JSON definitions
├── package.json     # Project dependencies
├── index.ts        # Application entry point
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```
