**nanoservice-ts** is an open-source framework designed to revolutionize backend development by enabling developers to build lightweight, modular, and reusable Nano Services with ease.

## What are nanoservices?
Nano Services are the smallest units of backend functionality, designed to:
* Be lightweight and modular.
* Execute specific tasks independently.
* Promote reusability and scalability.

Unlike monolithic architectures or microservices that bundle multiple tasks, Nano Services focus on a single responsibility, allowing:
* **Simplified Development**: Write smaller, focused functions.
* **Improved Performance**: Optimize resource usage for each Nano Service.
* **Flexible Workflows**: Chain Nano Services together to create complex backend processes.

Nano Services empower developers to build efficient, modular, and highly maintainable backends by combining these focused units into workflows.

## Why nanoservice-ts?
Backend development has often been plagued by complexity and overengineering. nanoservice-ts addresses these challenges by:
* Breaking down backend logic into small, independent Nano Services.
* Providing an intuitive, TypeScript-powered framework to define workflows and nodes.
* Simplifying project setup with ready-to-use templates and an npx CLI tool.

## What are the key features?

üöÄ **Lightweight and Modular** - Nano Services allow you to break down backend logic into small, independent units that are easy to manage, test, and scale.

üõ†Ô∏è **Programmatic Workflow Creation** - Use intuitive TypeScript helpers to define workflows programmatically, eliminating the need to manually write JSON.

‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Nodes** - Develop and reuse custom nodes for specific tasks. Combine them into workflows to solve complex backend problems.

üß© **Pre-Built Templates** - Jumpstart your projects with ready-made templates, such as HTTP APIs, scheduled tasks, or custom workflows.

üîÑ **Reusability** - Nano Services are reusable across workflows and projects, reducing redundancy and accelerating development.

üíª **Developer-Friendly CLI** - A powerful CLI simplifies project creation, node management, and development workflows: `npx nanoservice-cli`

ü§ù **Community-Driven** - Leverage a growing library of community-created nodes and templates. Share your work to help others.

**nanoservice-ts**: Designed to make backend development modular, scalable, and efficient for developers everywhere.
