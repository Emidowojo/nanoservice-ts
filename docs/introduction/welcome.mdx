**nanoservice-ts** is an open-source framework empowering developers to build lightweight, modular, and scalable backend applications with nanoservices.

## What are nanoservices?
Nanoservices are the smallest, independently executable units of backend functionality, designed to:
* **Focus on a Single Responsibility**: Each nanoservice performs one well-defined task.
* **Be Lightweight and Modular**: Minimal dependencies, optimized for reusability.
* **Enable Independent Execution**: Containerized to ensure isolation and scalability.

## Why nanoservices?
Traditional backend architectures, whether monolithic or microservices-based, often overcomplicate development and scaling. Nanoservices overcome these challenges by:
* **Simplifying Development**: Write small, focused units of logic.
* **Optimizing Resource Usage**: Scale individual services based on need.
* **Enhancing Workflow Flexibility**: Combine nanoservices into dynamic workflows tailored to complex backend processes.

## What nanoservices-ts is for?
**nanoservice-ts** provides a developer-first framework for adopting the nanoservices architecture, offering:

* **Ease of Use**: An intuitive TypeScript-powered API for defining workflows and nodes.
* **Streamlined Setup**: Start quickly with pre-configured templates and an npx CLI tool.
* **Modularity at Scale**: Build backend systems with reusable, independent components.


## Key Features?

üöÄ **Modular Architecture**
Break down backend logic into reusable, containerized nanoservices that simplify management and scaling.

üõ†Ô∏è **Code-First Workflow Definition**
Leverage TypeScript to programmatically define workflows and nodes, avoiding manual JSON creation.

‚öôÔ∏è **Custom Nodes**
Build, share, and reuse nodes tailored to specific tasks. Compose these into complex, maintainable workflows.

üß© **Pre-Built Templates**
Kickstart your projects with templates for common backend needs, including HTTP APIs, scheduled tasks, and custom workflows.

üîÑ **Reusability by Design**
Reuse nanoservices across workflows and projects to reduce redundancy and speed up development.

üíª **Developer-Centric CLI**
A powerful CLI simplifies project creation, node management, and deployment. Start in seconds with npx nanoservice-cli.

ü§ù **Community-Powered Ecosystem**
Access and contribute to a growing library of community-built nodes and workflows. Collaborate and share innovation.
