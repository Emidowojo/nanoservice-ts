# CLI: Project Management (`nanoctl create project`)

Managing Nanoservice-ts projects effectively starts with the `nanoctl` CLI. This section focuses on commands related to project creation and overall project lifecycle management, primarily the `create project` command.

## `nanoctl create project <project-name>`

This is typically the first `nanoctl` command you will use when starting a new Nanoservice-ts application.

**Purpose**: To scaffold a new Nanoservice-ts project with a predefined directory structure, necessary configuration files, and optional templates.

**Usage**:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create project [project-name] [options]
# or if nanoctl is installed globally or as a project dependency
# nanoctl create project [project-name] [options]
```

*   **`[project-name]`** (optional): The desired name for your project. If not provided, the CLI will usually prompt you for it. The project will be created in a new directory with this name.

**Interactive Prompts & Options**:

When you run `nanoctl create project`, the CLI will typically guide you through a series of prompts:

1.  **Project Name**: If not provided as an argument, it will ask:
    ```
    ? What is your project name? (my-nanoservice-app) my-new-app
    ```

2.  **Template Selection**: Nanoservice-ts often provides project templates to get you started quickly. You might see a prompt like:
    ```
    ? Select a template: (Use arrow keys)
    ‚ùØ blank           - A blank project to start from scratch
      hello-world     - A simple project with a pre-built HTTP workflow
      api-starter     - A template for building a REST API (conceptual)
      event-processor - A template for an event-driven application (conceptual)
    ```
    *   **`blank`**: Creates a minimal project structure with only the essential configuration files. This is suitable if you want to build everything from the ground up.
    *   **`hello-world`** (or similar): Provides a basic, runnable example, often including a simple HTTP-triggered workflow and a sample Node. This is great for beginners to see a working example immediately.
    *   Other templates might be available depending on the Nanoservice-ts version and community contributions.

3.  **(Potentially) Other Options**: Depending on the CLI version, there might be additional prompts for things like:
    *   Initializing a Git repository.
    *   Installing dependencies automatically.
    *   Choosing a package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm).

**What it Does**:

Upon completion, the `nanoctl create project` command will:

1.  Create a new directory with your project name.
2.  Populate this directory with the standard Nanoservice-ts project structure based on the chosen template. This typically includes:
    *   `nodes/` directory for your custom Nodes.
    *   `workflows/` directory for your workflow JSON definitions.
    *   `package.json` for managing Node.js dependencies.
    *   `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.
    *   `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and other common project files.
    *   Environment variable example file (e.g., `.env.example`).
3.  If a template with example code is chosen (like `hello-world`), it will include sample Node implementations and workflow definitions.
4.  It may also install necessary base dependencies if that option is selected or default.

**Example Invocation**:

To create a new project named `ecommerce-backend` using the `blank` template:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create project ecommerce-backend --template blank
```
(The `--template` flag is conceptual; the actual mechanism for selecting a template might be purely interactive or use a different flag.)

## Other Project-Related Commands (Conceptual)

While `create project` is the primary command, future versions of `nanoctl` or related tooling might include other project-level commands such as:

*   `nanoctl init`: To initialize Nanoservice-ts in an existing directory (less common for fully scaffolded frameworks).
*   `nanoctl doctor` or `nanoctl info`: To display information about the current project, Nanoservice-ts version, and environment.
*   `nanoctl upgrade`: To assist in upgrading project dependencies or configurations to a new Nanoservice-ts version.

The `create project` command is your gateway to building applications with Nanoservice-ts, ensuring you start with a consistent and well-structured foundation.
