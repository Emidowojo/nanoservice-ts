This section will detail the build-related commands provided by `nanoctl`, such as a conceptual `nanoctl build` command.

## Intended Content (`nanoctl build`)

*   **Purpose**: To compile, bundle, and prepare your Nanoservice-TS application for production deployment. This might involve:
    *   Transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript.
    *   Optimizing code (e.g., minification, tree-shaking).
    *   Packaging Nodes and Workflows into a deployable format.
    *   Generating any necessary runtime manifests or metadata.
    *   Copying static assets.
*   **Usage**:
    ```bash
    nanoctl build [options]
    ```
*   **Build Outputs**: Description of the artifacts generated by the build process (e.g., a `dist/` or `build/` directory structure).
*   **Configuration**: How the build process can be configured (e.g., via `nanoservice.config.json`, `tsconfig.json`, or command-line flags).
*   **Environment-Specific Builds**: How to create builds for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

Content for this command will be added once detailed information about its implementation in `nanoctl` is available.
