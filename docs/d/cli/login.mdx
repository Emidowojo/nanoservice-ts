## CLI: Authentication (`nanoctl login`)

**This page is a placeholder.**

This section will cover authentication-related commands provided by `nanoctl`, such as `nanoctl login`. These commands are typically used to authenticate the CLI with Nanoservice-TS backend services, a specific platform (like Deskree), or a registry for private Nodes/Workflows.

## Intended Content (`nanoctl login`)

*   **Purpose**: To authenticate your local `nanoctl` instance, allowing you to perform actions that require user identity (e.g., deploying to a specific account, accessing private resources).
*   **Usage**:
    ```bash
    nanoctl login [options]
    ```
*   **Authentication Methods**: Details on how authentication is handled (e.g., browser-based OAuth flow, API token input).
*   **Session Management**: Information on how login sessions are stored and managed locally, and how to check login status (`nanoctl whoami` - conceptual) or log out (`nanoctl logout` - conceptual).
*   **Use Cases**: When `nanoctl login` is required (e.g., before deploying to a managed Nanoservice-TS environment, publishing private nodes).

Content for this command, including specific options and behaviors, will be added once detailed information about its implementation in `nanoctl` is available.
