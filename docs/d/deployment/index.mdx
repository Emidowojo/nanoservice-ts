## Time to Deploy

Once you have developed and tested your Nanoservice-TS application, the next step is to deploy it to a production or staging environment. This section provides an overview of deployment strategies and considerations for Nanoservice-TS applications.

Nanoservice-TS applications, being composed of workflows and nodes, can be deployed to various environments, from serverless platforms to containerized setups.

## Key Deployment Considerations

*   **Environment Configuration**: Managing environment-specific configurations (e.g., API keys, database connection strings, service URLs) securely is crucial. This often involves using environment variables or a configuration management service.
*   **Scalability**: Choose a deployment platform that can scale your Nanoservice-TS application based on demand. Serverless platforms often provide auto-scaling capabilities.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement robust logging within your Nodes and Workflows. Integrate with monitoring tools to track the health, performance, and errors of your deployed application.
*   **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process. This ensures consistent and reliable deployments.
*   **Cold Starts (for Serverless)**: If deploying to serverless platforms, be aware of potential cold start latencies and consider strategies to mitigate them if they impact your application (e.g., provisioned concurrency, keep-warm techniques).
*   **Resource Management**: Understand the resource requirements (CPU, memory) of your Nanoservice-TS runtime and individual workflows to provision your deployment environment appropriately.

## Common Deployment Targets

Nanoservice-TS applications can be deployed to a variety of platforms. The user feedback specifically mentioned interest in the following:

*   **[Deskree Serverless](./deskree-serverless.mdx)**: (Placeholder) Deploying to Deskree's serverless offering, which might provide native support or optimized integration for Nanoservice-TS.
*   **[AWS Lambda](./aws-lambda.mdx)**: (Placeholder) Packaging and deploying Nanoservice-TS applications as AWS Lambda functions, often fronted by API Gateway for HTTP triggers or integrated with other AWS services for event-driven workflows.
*   **[Google Cloud Run](./gcp-cloud-run.mdx)**: (Placeholder) Deploying Nanoservice-TS applications as containerized services on Google Cloud Run, which offers a fully managed serverless platform for containers.

Other potential deployment targets include:

*   **Other Serverless Platforms**: Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers, etc.
*   **Container Orchestration Platforms**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm. Your Nanoservice-TS application can be packaged as a Docker container and managed by these platforms.
*   **Virtual Machines or Bare Metal**: Traditional deployment, where you manage the underlying infrastructure and the Nanoservice-TS runtime environment.

## General Deployment Steps (Conceptual)

1.  **Build Your Application**: Use `nanoctl build` (or an equivalent build process) to create a production-ready package of your Nanoservice-TS application. This typically includes transpiled JavaScript, workflow definitions, node configurations, and any other necessary assets.
2.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up environment-specific configurations for your target deployment environment.
3.  **Choose a Deployment Strategy**: Select the platform and method for deployment (e.g., serverless function, container image).
4.  **Package for Deployment**: Adapt your build output for the chosen platform (e.g., create a ZIP file for Lambda, build a Docker image for Cloud Run/Kubernetes).
5.  **Deploy**: Use platform-specific tools or `nanoctl deploy` (if it supports your target) to deploy your application.
6.  **Test**: Thoroughly test your deployed application in the target environment.
7.  **Monitor**: Set up monitoring and alerting to observe your application in production.

This section will provide more detailed guides for specific deployment targets as information becomes available or is developed.
