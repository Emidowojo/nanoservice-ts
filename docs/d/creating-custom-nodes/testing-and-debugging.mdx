title: Testing & debugging
---

Testing and debugging your custom nodes ensures they work reliably and integrate seamlessly into workflows. This guide covers testing your nodes using the provided template and debugging techniques for faster development.

---

## 1. Testing a Node
Custom node templates include a `test` folder and a sample test file (`index.test.ts`) to validate your node's logic.

### Folder Structure
```plaintext
node-template/
├── test/
│   └── index.test.ts
├── index.ts
├── config.json
└── package.json
```

### Writing Test Cases
Use tools like *Jest* or *Mocha* (based on the provided template). The default `template` includes a basic example to validate your node logic.

Example of `index.test.ts`:

``` typescript
import { beforeAll, expect, test } from "vitest";
import Node from "../index";
import ctx from "./helper";

let node: Node;

beforeAll(() => {
	node = new Node();
	node.name = "api-call";
});

// Validate Hello World from Node
test("Hello World from Node", async () => {
	const response = await node.handle(ctx(), {});
	expect({ message: "Hello World from Node!" }, response.data);
});
```
### Running Tests
Run the following command to execute tests:

```bash
npm run test
This ensures your node performs as expected.
```

## 2. Debugging a Node
For debugging, the template uses `nodemon` to enable live reloading during development.

### Running Your Node in Development Mode
To debug your node while actively coding, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:dev
This command uses nodemon to restart your node every time you save a change, simplifying the development process.
```

## 3. Debugging Techniques
### Logging Output
Use `console.log()` statements to log variables or responses during execution.

#### Example:

```typescript
console.log("API Response:", result);
```

### Inspecting Errors
If an error occurs, the `BlueprintNode` class captures the stack trace and returns a structured error. Check the error logs to locate issues:

```typescript
try {
    // logic
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
}
```

### Manual Testing
Use tools like **Postman** or **cURL** to trigger the workflow that includes your custom node and observe responses:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/workflow -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

## 4. Tips for Effective Testing

*Write unit tests for edge cases.

*Test API integration with mock tools.

*Validate node inputs and outputs thoroughly.

*Use descriptive test names and logging to ease debugging.

## 5. Final Notes
Testing and debugging are critical for ensuring your custom nodes meet quality standards. With the tools and practices provided in the template, you can confidently develop and troubleshoot nodes to enhance your workflows.
