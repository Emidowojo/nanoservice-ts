## About

Welcome to the Nanoservice-TS examples section! Here, you will find a collection of practical examples demonstrating how to use Nanoservice-TS to build various types of applications and implement common patterns. Each example is designed to be a hands-on guide, complete with explanations and code snippets.

## Getting Started with Examples

Most examples are structured as self-contained projects or can be easily integrated into a standard Nanoservice-TS project created with `nanoctl`.

To run these examples, you will generally need:

1.  A Nanoservice-TS project set up (see [First Steps](../introduction/first-steps.mdx)).
2.  The `nanoctl` CLI tool.
3.  Any specific dependencies mentioned in the individual example (e.g., database clients, external API keys if applicable).

Typically, you can clone the main Nanoservice-TS repository or a dedicated examples repository if available. Each example might have its own subdirectory with `nodes/`, `workflows/`, and a `README.md` or be part of a larger collection.

## Available Examples

Here is a list of the examples covered in this documentation. Click on each link to explore the detailed guide:

*   **[API Call](./api-call.mdx)**: Demonstrates how to make external API calls from a Nanoservice workflow, fetch data, and process the response.
*   **[Routing Logic](./routing.mdx)**: Shows how to implement conditional routing within a workflow, directing the flow based on input data or results from previous nodes (e.g., "Cat Facts vs. Country Info" type of decision).
*   **[Single Page UI](./single-page-ui.mdx)**: Illustrates how to use a UI Node to return simple HTML or a basic user interface directly from a Nanoservice workflow.
*   **[Database Smart Query (DB Manager)](./db-manager.mdx)**: An advanced example showcasing dynamic database query generation and execution, potentially integrating with an AI model to interpret natural language queries.
*   **[AI Workflow Documentation Generator](./workflow-docs.mdx)**: Demonstrates using Nanoservice-TS, possibly with AI capabilities, to automatically generate documentation for existing workflows.
*   **[AI Dashboard Generator](./dashboard-generator.mdx)**: An example of creating dynamic dashboards, potentially leveraging AI to configure or populate the dashboard based on data or user input.
*   **[Base64 to PDF](./base64-pdf.mdx)**: A utility-focused example showing how to convert Base64 encoded strings into PDF files within a workflow.
*   **[Feedback UI](./feedback-ui.mdx)**: An example of building a simple feedback collection mechanism, possibly involving a UI Node and data storage.
*   **[PostgreSQL Query](./postgres-query.mdx)**: A straightforward example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database and executing queries.

## How to Use This Section

1.  **Browse the list**: Find an example that matches a pattern or problem you are trying to solve.
2.  **Read the overview**: Each example page will start with a description of its purpose and what it demonstrates.
3.  **Examine the code**: Review the Node implementations (`index.ts` and `node.json`) and the Workflow definitions (`workflow.json`).
4.  **Follow setup instructions**: If there are specific setup steps (e.g., installing dependencies, setting environment variables), make sure to follow them.
5.  **Run the example**: Execute the workflow as described, usually by starting the Nanoservice runner and triggering it (e.g., via an HTTP request).
6.  **Experiment**: Modify the example code to better understand its workings or to adapt it to your own needs.

These examples are intended to be a starting point. We encourage you to build upon them and explore the full potential of Nanoservice-TS.
