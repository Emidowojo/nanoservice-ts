## Example: AI Workflow Documentation Generator

**This page is a placeholder.**

The content for the "AI Workflow Documentation Generator" example is currently unavailable. This example is intended to demonstrate using Nanoservice-TS, possibly with AI capabilities, to automatically generate documentation for existing Nanoservice-TS workflows.

## Intended Purpose

*   Showcase integration with AI models for content generation.
*   Illustrate how Nanoservice-TS can be used for developer tooling.
*   Provide an example of introspecting workflow definitions.

We will update this page once the content is available.
