title: Deployment
---

**Http Trigger** includes the Dockerfile. Hence, you can deploy it to any cloud service like AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc.

---

You can also deploy using `docker compose` in development or staging environment using our `docker-compose.yml` and configurations files included in the `/infra`
directory.

To get the templates, you must clone our github repository into your local computer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deskree-inc/nanoservice-ts.git nanoservice-ts
cd nanoservice-ts
cd infra

# Using the default settings without Logs
docker compose up -d

# Testing
curl -i -GET 'http://localhost:4000/countries' 

# Grafana
# http://localhost:3000 
# user: admin
# pass: admin

# To activate the logs to be displayed in Grafana Dashboard, you must install the Docker Plugin following the instruction bellow.
