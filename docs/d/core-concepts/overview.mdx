The Nanoservice-ts Command Line Interface (`nanoctl`) is your primary tool for scaffolding, developing, and managing Nanoservice-ts applications. It streamlines common tasks, enforces project structure, and helps you get up and running quickly.

## Purpose of `nanoctl`

`nanoctl` is designed to:

-   **Scaffold New Projects:** Create a new Nanoservice-ts project with a standard directory structure and essential configuration files.
-   **Generate Components:** Quickly generate boilerplate code for new Nodes and Workflows, including their respective `index.ts` and `package.json` (for Nodes) or workflow JSON files.
-   **Manage Dependencies (Potentially):** While primarily relying on npm/yarn, future versions might offer more integrated dependency management for nodes.
-   **Run Development Servers:** (Often handled by npm scripts calling `nodemon` and the Nanoservice runner, but `nanoctl` might offer direct commands in the future).
-   **Build for Production:** (Similarly, often an npm script, but `nanoctl` could provide build commands).
-   **Deployment Assistance (Future):** Potentially offer commands to help package or deploy Nanoservice-ts applications.

## Installation

As covered in the [Installation Guide](./../introduction/installation.mdx), the recommended way to use `nanoctl` is via `npx` to ensure you always have the latest version:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest <command>
```

Alternatively, you can install it globally:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g @nanoservice-ts/cli

# Using yarn
yarn global add @nanoservice-ts/cli
```

If installed globally, you can use the `nanoctl` command directly.

## Core Commands

Here are some of the fundamental commands provided by `nanoctl`.

### `nanoctl create project`

This command initializes a new Nanoservice-ts project.

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create project
```

It will prompt you for a project name and then create a new directory with that name, setting up:

-   Standard project directories (`src/`, `workflows/`, `src/nodes/`).
-   Core configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `nodemon.json`, `Dockerfile`).
-   Basic example Node and Workflow (often, or a very minimal setup).
-   Installs necessary base dependencies like `@nanoservice-ts/runner` and `@nanoservice-ts/shared`.

### `nanoctl create node`

This command scaffolds a new Nanoservice Node within an existing project.

```bash
# Navigate to your project root first
cd my-nanoservice-project
npx nanoctl@latest create node
```

It will prompt for:

-   **Node Name:** (e.g., `data-validator`, `email-sender`). This name is used for the directory and often as the default registration key.
-   **Description:** A brief explanation of the Node's purpose.
-   **Category:** A category for organizing your Nodes (e.g., `Utilities`, `Integrations`, `AI`).

This command creates:

-   A new directory: `src/nodes/<node-name>/`
-   `src/nodes/<node-name>/index.ts`: A template TypeScript file for your Node class, extending `NanoService`.
-   `src/nodes/<node-name>/package.json`: A `package.json` file for the Node, including placeholders for `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`.

You will then need to implement the Node logic in `index.ts` and define its schemas in its `package.json`.

### `nanoctl create workflow`

This command generates a new Workflow definition file.

```bash
# Navigate to your project root first
cd my-nanoservice-project
npx nanoctl@latest create workflow
```

It will prompt for:

-   **Workflow Name:** (e.g., `process-new-order`, `daily-data-sync`).
-   **Description:** A brief explanation of the Workflow's purpose.
-   **Trigger Type:** (e.g., `HTTP`, `Schedule`).
-   **Trigger-Specific Details:** (e.g., for HTTP: path and method; for Schedule: cron expression).

This command creates a new JSON file in the `workflows/json/` directory (e.g., `workflows/json/process-new-order.json`) with a basic structure for the workflow, including the trigger definition and empty `steps` and `nodes` sections.

## Command Structure (General)

`nanoctl` commands typically follow a pattern:

```bash
nanoctl [command] [subcommand] [options]
```

-   **`command`**: The main action group (e.g., `create`).
-   **`subcommand`**: The specific item to act upon (e.g., `project`, `node`, `workflow`).
-   **`options`**: Optional flags to modify behavior (e.g., `--help`, `--version`, or command-specific options).

### Getting Help

You can usually get help for `nanoctl` or a specific command by using the `--help` flag:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest --help
npx nanoctl@latest create --help
npx nanoctl@latest create node --help
```

## Future Possibilities

The `nanoctl` CLI is an evolving tool. Future enhancements might include:

-   Commands for listing registered nodes and available workflows.
-   More sophisticated build and packaging commands.
-   Integration with testing frameworks.
-   Deployment helpers for common platforms.
-   Commands to update project dependencies or migrate configurations.

Refer to the official Nanoservice-ts documentation or the CLI's help output for the most up-to-date list of commands and features.

By leveraging `nanoctl`, you can significantly speed up your Nanoservice-ts development process and ensure consistency across your projects.
