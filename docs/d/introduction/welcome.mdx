**Nanoservice-ts** is an open-source, TypeScript-first framework designed to simplify the way developers build modular, scalable, and maintainable backend applications.

Think of building a complex backend like constructing with LEGO¬Æ bricks. Instead of large, cumbersome blocks (like monoliths or even some microservices), Nanoservice-ts provides you with small, specialized bricks ‚Äì **nanoservices**. Each nanoservice is the smallest, independently executable unit of backend functionality, focused on doing **one thing well**.

This approach tackles the complexity often found in traditional backend architectures by promoting:

- **Single Responsibility:** Each nanoservice has a clearly defined purpose (e.g., sending an email, validating input, processing a payment).
- **Modularity & Reusability:** Nanoservices are designed to be easily reused across different parts of your application or even in different projects.
- **Independent Scalability:** Scale individual nanoservices based on demand, optimizing resource usage.
- **Isolation:** Nanoservices run in isolated environments (like containers), preventing failures in one part from cascading through the system.

## Why Choose Nanoservice-ts?

Nanoservice-ts provides a developer-centric experience for building applications using the nanoservices architecture:

- üöÄ **Simplified Development:** Focus on writing small, testable units of logic in TypeScript.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Code-First Workflows:** Define complex business logic and data flows programmatically using TypeScript, avoiding cumbersome configuration files.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Extensibility:** Easily create custom Nodes (nanoservices) tailored to your specific needs.
- üß© **Rapid Prototyping:** Get started quickly with project templates and a powerful CLI (`nanoctl`).
- üîÑ **Enhanced Reusability:** Build a library of reusable nanoservices to accelerate future development.
- üîí **Type Safety:** Leverage TypeScript throughout your backend for more robust and maintainable code.
- ü§ù **Community Driven:** Benefit from and contribute to a growing ecosystem of nodes and workflows.

## Nanoservices vs. Microservices vs. Monoliths

How do nanoservices fit into the architectural landscape?

| Feature                 | Monolithic                  | Microservices                 | Nanoservices (via Nanoservice-ts)         |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Responsibility Scope**| Broad, multiple concerns    | Focused business capability   | **Single, well-defined task (SRP)**       |
| **Granularity**         | Coarse                      | Moderate                      | **Fine-grained**                          |
| **Modularity**          | Low                         | Medium                        | **High**                                  |
| **Reusability**         | Low (within monolith)       | Medium (service level)        | **High (node level)**                     |
| **Scalability**         | Scale entire application    | Scale individual services     | **Scale individual nodes/workflows**      |
| **Development Focus**   | Entire application          | Business domain service       | **Individual function/task**              |
| **Communication**       | Internal function calls     | Network calls (often REST/gRPC) | **Workflow orchestration**                |

Nanoservices, particularly as implemented by Nanoservice-ts, emphasize the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** at a very granular level. They are not just *smaller* microservices; they are fundamentally about breaking down logic into the smallest reusable and independently executable units, orchestrated by workflows.
