## Starting

This guide will walk you through setting up your Nanoservice-TS development environment and creating your first nanoservice-based application. We aim to get you up and running as quickly as possible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Nanoservice-TS is built on Node.js. We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** (or **yarn**): npm is included with Node.js. If you prefer yarn, ensure it is installed.

## Installation

The primary way to interact with Nanoservice-TS and manage your projects is through our Command Line Interface (CLI), `nanoctl`.

You don't need to install `nanoctl` globally to start. You can use `npx` to run the latest version directly:

## Creating Your First Project

Let's create a new Nanoservice-TS project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create project
```

The CLI will prompt you for a project name and potentially other configuration options. For this guide, you can accept the defaults.

```
? What is your project name? (my-nanoservice-app) my-first-app
? Select a template: (Use arrow keys)
❯ blank - A blank project to start from scratch
  hello-world - A simple project with a pre-built HTTP workflow
```

Let's choose the `hello-world` template for a quick start. This will create a new directory named `my-first-app` (or whatever you named your project) with the basic Nanoservice-TS project structure and an example workflow.

Navigate into your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-first-app
```

## Project Structure

Inside your project, you'll find a structure similar to this (for the `hello-world` template):

```
my-first-app/
├── nodes/
│   └── examples/
│       └── hello-node/
│           ├── index.ts
│           └── node.json
├── workflows/
│   └── examples/
│       └── http-hello-world.json
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json
```

*   `nodes/`: Contains the source code for your custom Nodes.
*   `workflows/`: Contains JSON definitions for your Workflows.
*   `package.json`: Standard Node.js project manifest.
*   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.

We will explore these in more detail in the [Project Structure](../fundamentals/project-structure.mdx) section.

## Running Your First Workflow

The `hello-world` template comes with a simple HTTP workflow. To run it locally:

1.  **Install dependencies** (if you haven't already inside the project):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

2.  **Start the Nanoservice-TS runner** in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    This command typically starts a local server that listens for triggers to execute your workflows. You should see output indicating the server is running, often on `http://localhost:4000`.

3.  **Trigger the workflow**:
    The `http-hello-world.json` workflow is usually configured to respond to a GET request. Open your web browser or use a tool like `curl` or Postman to access the endpoint. If the workflow is named `http-hello-world`, the default URL will be:
    `http://localhost:4000/http-hello-world`

    You should receive a response like:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello from Nanoservice-TS!"
    }
    ```

Congratulations! You've successfully created and run your first Nanoservice-TS application.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to set up and run a Nanoservice-TS project, you can explore further:

*   Learn more about [Nodes](./nodes.mdx) - the building blocks of your application.
*   Understand [Workflows](./workflows.mdx) in more detail.
*   Discover how [Triggers](./triggers.mdx) initiate your workflows.
*   Dive into the [Context Object](./context.mdx) for data sharing.
*   Explore the available [Examples](../examples/index.mdx) for more complex use cases.
*   Deepen your knowledge with the [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/overview.mdx) section.

Happy building!
