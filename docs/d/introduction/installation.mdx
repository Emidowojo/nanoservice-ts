# Installation

Getting started with Nanoservice-ts is straightforward. The primary way to interact with and manage your Nanoservice-ts projects is through the `nanoctl` command-line interface (CLI).

## Installing `nanoctl` (CLI)

`nanoctl` is the official CLI tool for Nanoservice-ts. It helps you create new projects, generate nodes and workflows, and manage your Nanoservice-ts applications.

### Using npx (Recommended)

The recommended way to use `nanoctl` without needing a global installation is via `npx`, which comes bundled with Node.js (version 5.2.0+).

To create a new project, you can run:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create project
```

To generate a new node within an existing project:

```bash
npx nanoctl@latest create node
```

Using `npx nanoctl@latest` ensures you are always using the most recent version of the CLI.

### Global Installation (Optional)

If you prefer to have `nanoctl` installed globally, you can do so using npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g @nanoservice-ts/cli

# Using yarn
yarn global add @nanoservice-ts/cli
```

Once installed globally, you can use the `nanoctl` command directly:

```bash
nanoctl create project
nanoctl create node
```

**Note:** If you install globally, remember to periodically update to the latest version:

```bash
# Using npm
npm update -g @nanoservice-ts/cli

# Using yarn
yarn global upgrade @nanoservice-ts/cli
```

## Project Setup

When you create a new project using `nanoctl create project`, the CLI scaffolds a new directory with a standard structure. Let's look at what gets generated:

```plaintext
my-nanoservice-project/
├── .env.local                # Local environment variables (ignored by Git)
├── .gitignore                # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore
├── Dockerfile                # For containerizing your application
├── nodemon.json              # Configuration for nodemon (development auto-restarts)
├── package.json              # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript compiler options
├── public/                   # Static assets (if any)
├── workflows/                # Workflow definitions
│   └── json/                 # JSON workflow files (generated by CLI)
│   └── ts/                   # (Optional) TypeScript workflow files
└── src/                      # Source code for your application
    ├── nodes/                # Your custom Nanoservice Nodes
    │   └── example-node/     # Example of a node directory
    │       ├── index.ts
    │       └── package.json
    ├── types/                # Shared TypeScript types for your project
    ├── Nodes.ts              # Central registration file for your nodes
    ├── Workflow.ts           # (Optional) Base class or helpers for TS workflows
    └── index.ts              # Main entry point for your application
```

### Key Directories and Files:

-   **`.env.local`**: Store environment-specific variables here, such as API keys or database credentials for local development. This file should not be committed to version control.
-   **`Dockerfile`**: A standard Dockerfile to build a container image for your Nanoservice-ts application, making deployment easier.
-   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies (like `@nanoservice-ts/runner`, `@nanoservice-ts/shared`), and npm scripts (e.g., `dev`, `build`, `start`).
-   **`workflows/`**: This directory houses your workflow definitions. The CLI typically generates JSON workflows in the `workflows/json/` subdirectory.
-   **`src/`**: Contains all your TypeScript source code.
    -   **`src/nodes/`**: Each subdirectory here represents an individual Nanoservice Node. The CLI generates a standard structure for each node, including its `index.ts` (implementation) and `package.json` (metadata and schemas).
    -   **`src/Nodes.ts`**: This crucial file is where you register all your custom nodes, making them available to the Nanoservice-ts runtime and your workflows.
    -   **`src/index.ts`**: The main application entry point that initializes and starts the Nanoservice-ts engine.

With `nanoctl` installed and your project set up, you are ready to start building your first nodes and workflows! Refer to the [First Steps](./first-steps.mdx) guide to continue.
