title: Atomic & Nanoservices
---

When exploring the **Deskree ecosystem**, it’s essential to understand the distinction between **Atomic Computing**, **Nanoservices**, and **nanoservice-ts**. While they are interrelated, they serve distinct purposes in enabling modern, modular, and scalable backend development.  

---

## **1. What Are Nanoservices?**  

**Nanoservices** are an **architectural approach** for backend development.  
They focus on:  
- Breaking down backend logic into **small, single-responsibility units**.  
- Ensuring each nanoservice can operate **independently** and be reused across workflows.  
- Enabling the creation of **flexible, modular systems** that are easier to manage, test, and scale.  

### Key Features of Nanoservices:  
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each nanoservice performs one well-defined task.  
- **Containerized Execution**: Services run in isolated environments, ensuring fault tolerance and security.  
- **Independent Scalability**: Scale individual nanoservices as needed without impacting others.  

**Nanoservices** are a **conceptual framework**, not a tool. To implement nanoservices effectively, developers need supporting frameworks and infrastructure.

## **2. nanoservice-ts: The Framework for Nanoservices**  

**nanoservice-ts** is an open-source framework that helps developers **implement the nanoservices architecture**.  

### How nanoservice-ts Supports Nanoservices:  
- **Code-First Approach**: Define workflows and nodes programmatically using TypeScript.  
- **Reusable Components**: Create custom nodes and workflows that can be used across projects.  
- **Simplified Development**: Provides a CLI and pre-built templates for rapid project setup.  
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Easily chain nanoservices into complex workflows.  

In short, **nanoservice-ts** bridges the gap between the architectural principles of nanoservices and their practical application in real-world backend systems.

## **3. What Is Atomic Computing?**  

**Atomic Computing** is the **infrastructure-side implementation** of nanoservices, powering the Deskree Atomic Platform.  
It is a cutting-edge resource management and execution model designed to:  
- Support **vertical scaling** by dynamically allocating resources in real-time.  
- Ensure **container-based isolation** for secure, fault-tolerant execution of nanoservices.  
- Optimize resource utilization using predictive algorithms and automated provisioning.  

### Core Innovations of Atomic Computing:  
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Automatically adjusts CPU, memory, and other resources based on demand.  
- **Containerized Execution**: Each nanoservice runs in its own isolated container, ensuring no cross-service interference.  
- **Vertical Scaling**: Focuses on increasing server capacity (e.g., CPU/memory) rather than adding more servers, simplifying scaling and reducing overhead.  

### How Atomic Computing Relates to Nanoservices:  
- **Execution Layer**: Atomic Computing provides the runtime environment for nanoservices, ensuring they are scalable, secure, and efficient.  
- **Performance Optimization**: It automates resource management to deliver optimal performance for nanoservice-based workflows.

| **Purpose**                 | Enable scalable, reusable, and fault-tolerant backend systems. | Provide a high-performance, dynamic execution environment for nanoservices. |  
| **Scope**                   | Conceptual framework for system design. | Infrastructure and runtime layer for execution. |  
| **Key Features**            | Modularity, SRP, containerized execution. | Dynamic resource allocation, vertical scaling, container isolation. |  
| **Relationship**            | Defines the “what” and “why” of nanoservice architecture. | Powers the “how” of running and managing nanoservices. |

## **How nanoservice-ts Fits In**  

**nanoservice-ts** is the **framework** that connects the **nanoservices architecture** with **Atomic Computing infrastructure**. It allows developers to:  
1. **Define and Orchestrate Nanoservices**: Use TypeScript to create workflows and nodes based on nanoservice principles.  
2. **Leverage Atomic Computing**: Automatically tap into the dynamic scaling, resource optimization, and container isolation provided by the Atomic Platform.  
3. **Focus on Logic, Not Infrastructure**: With nanoservice-ts, developers can focus on writing modular business logic without worrying about deployment or scaling complexities.

## **Key Takeaways**  

- **Nanoservices**: A design philosophy focused on building small, single-responsibility backend services.  
- **nanoservice-ts**: A developer-first framework that simplifies implementing nanoservices.  
- **Atomic Computing**: The infrastructure that makes nanoservices scalable, secure, and resource-efficient on the Deskree Atomic Platform.  

Together, these components create a seamless ecosystem for building modern, modular, and scalable backend applications.
