title: TS Helpers
---

In addition to templates, nanoservice-ts provides TypeScript helpers for programmatic workflow creation.

Hereâ€™s an example of defining a workflow:

```TypeScript
Workflow("my-workflow")
  .trigger("http", config)
  .addStep(apiFetchNode)
  .addStep(customNode)
  .response("json");
```

This approach allows you to define workflows dynamically and leverage the power of TypeScript for better maintainability and flexibility.
