title: Using Templates
---

The Templates folder in the nanoservice-ts GitHub repository provides pre-built templates that help developers and contributors quickly set up projects, create custom nodes, or extend the ecosystem.

Whether you're starting as a developer or a contributor, these templates ensure a faster and easier workflow setup.

# Available Templates

### Create Custom Nodes

Use this template to build your own **custom nodes** for nanoservice-ts.

Custom nodes can be packaged and published to npmjs, making them reusable across the community.

Key Files:

* `config.json`: Configure inputs, outputs, and node metadata.

* `index.ts`: Write the core logic of your custom node.

### Create Triggers

Use this template to build **triggers** that initiate workflows (e.g., HTTP, Scheduled Jobs).

Triggers are essential for connecting workflows to external events.

Key File:

* `index.ts`: Write the logic for handling the trigger event.

### Starter Workflow Templates

Quickly initialize a project with pre-defined workflows.

Examples include HTTP APIs, scheduled workflows, and custom logic examples.
