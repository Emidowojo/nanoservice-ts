title: Using Templates
---

Templates in **nanoservice-ts** help you get started quickly by providing pre-configured setups for common use cases like HTTP APIs, scheduled jobs, and custom node development. With just a few commands, you’ll have a working project ready for your custom workflows.

## Quick Start
Start your project in minutes using the CLI: 

```bash
npx nanoservice-cli create project
```
Follow the prompts to:

1. Select a template.
2. Name your project.
3. Set up the project folder.

Once complete, your project will include all the necessary configurations to start coding immediately.
