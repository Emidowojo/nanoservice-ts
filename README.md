## About The Project  

**nanoservice-ts** is an open-source framework designed to simplify backend development by enabling developers to implement the **nanoservices architecture** effortlessly. Built with **TypeScript**, this framework helps you create lightweight, modular, and scalable backend systems that adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.  

By combining an intuitive API, programmatic workflow orchestration, and powerful tooling, nanoservice-ts allows you to focus on writing business logic while abstracting the complexities of infrastructure, scaling, and resource management.  

### Key Highlights  

- **Nanoservices Architecture**: Divide backend logic into reusable, single-responsibility units that are easy to manage, scale, and debug.  
- **Developer-Friendly Tools**: Use TypeScript-powered APIs, templates, and a CLI for quick project setup and workflow creation.  
- **Efficient and Scalable**: Built to support dynamic workflows with containerized execution and independent scalability for each nanoservice.  
- **Community-Driven**: Collaborate, share, and benefit from a growing library of community-created nodes and workflows.  

### Why nanoservice-ts?  

Modern backend development often suffers from over-engineered solutions, resource inefficiencies, and complex architectures. **nanoservice-ts** addresses these pain points by offering:  

- **Modular Design**: Reuse components across projects, reducing redundancy and improving productivity.  
- **Simplified Scaling**: Focus on scaling individual nanoservices based on real-time demands, optimizing resource usage.  
- **Flexibility**: Build workflows programmatically or using pre-built templates for common tasks like HTTP APIs, event processing, and scheduled jobs.  

With **nanoservice-ts**, backend development becomes modular, predictable, and future-proof, making it ideal for both small projects and large-scale systems.
